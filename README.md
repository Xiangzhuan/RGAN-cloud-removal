Paper:"SiENet: Siamese Expansion Network for Image Extrapolation"
# Abstract
In this paper,Optical remote sensing images are often affected by clouds during the acquisition process, resulting in low clarity of the acquired images, which affects the judgement of feature information and subsequent use, and thick cloud occlusion causes the surface information below to be completely invalid. We propose a soft attention recurrent neural module based on encoder-decoder network, which can solve the cloud occlusion problem, and propose adaptive partial convolution at the end of decoder by taking into account the spatial information, better than which accomplish the prediction of de-clouding, and our network achieves good results on RICE1 and RICE2 datasets.
